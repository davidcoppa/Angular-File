# Files using Subject

Angular project using subjet to comunicate the components.

passing a string to the main component when the file is upload in the server.

NOTE: the backend is not implemented in the project, you will have to do it. the response has to be a string (but of course you can modify it)

next versions will have:
- C# back end saving the file in a local server folder
- C# back end saving the file in a database
- a download, to download the file (could be an specific file or just the last one)
- a more friendly interface


- also could be a new project each of the features =)
